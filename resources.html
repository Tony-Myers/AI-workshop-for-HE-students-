        <h2>Key Conceptual Guides</h2>
        <p>Before using AI tools, it is essential to understand the core concepts of ethical use, academic integrity, and proper citation.</p>
        
        <div class="module">
            <h3><a href="ethics.html">Ethics, Bias, and Data Privacy</a></h3>
            <p>A critical guide to the real-world implications of using AI. This page covers data privacy, how AI can be biased, and your professional responsibilities when handling data.</p>

            <h3><a href="citing.html">A Practical Guide to Citing AI</a></h3>
            <p>This guide explains the difference between documenting your AI use (for your marker) and citing it (for your reader). It provides clear, "how-to" examples for APA 7th Edition.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Core AI Tools (University Recommended)</h2>
        <p>These are the primary, university-approved tools for your academic work. They are free to use with your university login and offer enhanced data protection.</p>

        <div class="module">
            <h3>Microsoft Copilot (General)</h3>
            <ul>
